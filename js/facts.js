            fact: "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, orbiting at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers. Despite its size, it has a major impact on Earth's tides due to its gravitational pull.",
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            fact: "The Moon is approximately 4.5 billion years old, just slightly younger than the Earth. Scientists believe it was formed after a massive collision between Earth and a Mars-sized object, known as Theia.",
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            fact: "The Moon’s gravity is only about 1/6th that of Earth's. This means a person weighing 60 kg on Earth would weigh just 10 kg on the Moon, which is why astronauts appear to 'bounce' when walking on the lunar surface.",
        },
        {
            id: 4,
            fact: "The Moon lacks a significant atmosphere, meaning there's no air to breathe, no weather, and no sound. Without an atmosphere, the surface is also exposed to harsh solar radiation and space debris.",
        },
        {
            id: 5,
            fact: "The 'dark side' of the Moon is a myth. In reality, both sides of the Moon receive sunlight at different times. The far side, which we never see from Earth, is not permanently dark but experiences day and night just like the near side.",
        },
        {
            id: 6,
            fact: "The Moon's surface is covered in countless craters, created by meteoroid impacts over billions of years. Due to the lack of atmosphere, there's no weather to erode these craters, so they remain visible for millennia.",
        },
        {
            id: 7,
            fact: "On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon as part of NASA's Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong's famous words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' became iconic.",
        },
        {
            id: 8,
            fact: "The Moon is slowly drifting away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. Over millions of years, this gradual separation affects Earth's tides and will continue to influence the length of days on Earth.",
        },
        {
            id: 9,
            fact: "The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, meaning it takes the same amount of time to rotate on its axis as it does to orbit Earth. As a result, we always see the same side of the Moon from Earth, known as the near side.",
        },
        {
            id: 10,
            fact: "Temperatures on the Moon's surface are extreme. During the lunar day, temperatures can soar up to 127°C (260°F), while during the lunar night, they can plunge to -173°C (-280°F), making it a very hostile environment.",
